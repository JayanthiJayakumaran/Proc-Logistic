# Proc-Logistic
This is the SAS code for the Proc Logistic procedure. Logistic regression describes the relationship between a categorical response variable and a set of predictor variables. A categorical response variable can be binary (success and failure) an ordinal (normal, mild, and severe), or a nominal variable (eye color, blood type). The data for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle and it was a titanic dataset.
